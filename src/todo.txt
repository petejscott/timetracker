BUGS
1. group summary total update not binding on new group creation until reload
2. delete group does not select a different group or clear the tasklist view
3. groupNavigationView uses a lot of prototyped functions that don't need to be public

FEATURES (may resolve #1)
1. appData object: make addGroup(group) which publishes and subscribes appropriately
2. group object: make addTask(task) which publishes and subscribes appropriately
3. [DONE] send appData around instead of groups array
4. send appData around instead of config
5. save appData instead of just groups
