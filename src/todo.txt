BUGS
1. group summary total update not binding on new group creation until reload
2. delete group does not select a different group or clear the tasklist view
3. groupNavigationView uses a lot of prototyped functions that don't need to be public

FEATURES (may resolve #1)
1. [DONE] appData object: make addGroup(group)
2. appData.addGroup should do pertinent publishes and subscribes
3. [DONE] group object: make addTask(task)
4. group.addTask should publish and subscribe appropriately
5. [DONE] send appData around instead of groups array
6. send appData around instead of config
